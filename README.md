GEOG 4/510 Exercises
====================
for GEOG 4/510 winter term 2015 at Portland State University


**Overview**

The exercises contained in this repo are designed to provide
students with an example of properly structured code solving
different problems and scenarios while simultaneously testing
each student's python comprehension. Each exercise consists
of a sample script in PDF image format. That is, the code is
not text, which can be selected and copied, but is an image.
This particular formatting is designed to prevent students from
taking the copy/paste shortcut when completing their exercises.

Instead, each student must type out the python code shown in
the example PDF into a .py file for submission. The act of
typing, as opposed to copying and pasting, helps to cement the
programming structures in the students' minds.

Another feature of the exercises is that all proper code
documentation is missing, from comments to variable names.
So, while typing in the example code, each student must also
add in all the missing comments and change all the variable,
function, and constant names.

All of the exercises are supplied with sample data that can
be used to test the operation of the scripts and help students
understand what each part of the code does.

**Submitting The Exercises**

All submissions can be emailed to the instructor with the
subject GEOG410: Exercise # Submision, substituting # with
the exercise number. In the case of single .py submissions,
simply attach the python script to the email. If multiple file
are to be submitted, please zip them together into a .zip file.
Please name any submitted python files or zipfiles with the
format LastnameFirstname_Exercise#, where again # is the
exercise number.
