Exercise 3: Vector Operations in OGR
====================================
for GEOG 410/510 winter term 2015


**Instructions**

The purpose of this exercise is to provide an example of
a script that uses the GDAL python bindings to perform an
advanced raster analysis operation. Given the complexity of
this operation, this exercise is provided with an editable .py file.
Moreover, the code has appropriate function and variable names.
All that is missing is the script description, the script instructions,
all the function docstrings, and all the comments.

Thus, your task is to add all this missing documentation.
Everywhere you find a `#` comment sign or the `""" """` docstring
notation you must add a comment
explaining what happens in the following statement and why (or, in the case
of docstrings, what a function does, its arguments, and its output).

*Note: I will be pretty picky about comments in the tough sections
of this exercise: I really want to make sure everyone understands
what is going on in this one. Please ask for help if you need it.*

Also included in the intro comment section are two questions.
I am looking for short answers, about a paragraph or two in length,
as appropriate.

I chose to provide the code for this exercise in an editable format,
simply due to the length of the script. However, I strongly suggest
you type out the example by hand into your own .py file rather
than simply editing the file I've provided.
I won't know the difference, but you will benefit;
typing out code examples and snippets by hand is much better for
memorization and learning than simply copying and pasting bits
and pieces from here and there.

Also included is a data directory containing a polygon shapefile
and a raster dataset.
You can run the script to see what the input
and output look like to ascertain the code's specific operations.
When calling the script, you will need to provide the path to
the data folder (not the shapefile) as an argument to the script.


**Submissions and Points**

All that need be submitted for this exercise is a .py file with the
commented and code. Please email it to the instructor,
attaching the file named as `LastnameFirstname_Exercise1.py`, with
your last name and first name.

This exercise is worth a total of 30 points. Points will be given
based on the quality/thoroughness of comments and the answers to the
included questions.
Keep in mind the point of this assignment is to test your code
comprehension; do not necessarily write comments as you might
for an actual script, but to show your understanding of every
step of the example program's execution. You will not be penalized
for too many comments, or for comments that are too long.
