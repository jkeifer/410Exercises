Exercise 3: Vector Operations in OGR
====================================
for GEOG 410/510 winter term 2015


**Instructions**

The purpose of this exercise is to provide an example of
a script that uses the OGR python bindings to preform a
basic vector analysis operation. Given the complexity of even
this simple operation, unlike previous exercises, this
exercise is provided with an editable .py text file.
Moreover, the code has appropriate function and variable names.
All that is missing is the script description, the script instructions,
all the function docstrings, and all the comments.

Thus, your task is to add all this missing documentation.
Everywhere you find a `#` comment sign or the `""" """` docstring
notation you must add a comment
explaining what happens in the following statement and why (or, in the case
of docstrings, what a function does, its arguments, and its output).

I chose to provide the code for this exercise in an editable format,
simply due to the length of the script. However, I strongly suggest
you type out the example by hand into your own .py file rather
than simply editing the file I've provided.
I won't know the difference, but you will benefit;
typing out code examples and snippets by hand is much better for
memorization and learning than simply copying and pasting bits
and pieces from here and there.

Also included is a data directory containing a point shapefile.
You can run the script to see what the input
and output look like to ascertain the code's specific operations.
When calling the script, you will need to provide the path to
the data folder (not the shapefile) as the first argument,
and the buffer distance (in feet) as the second argument.


**Submissions and Points**

All that need be submitted for this exercise is a .py file with the
commented and code. Please email it to the instructor,
attaching the file named as `LastnameFirstname_Exercise1.py`, with
your last name and first name.

This exercise is worth a total of 10 points. Points will be given
based on the quality/thoroughness of comments.
Keep in mind the point of this assignment is to test your code
comprehension; do not necessarily write comments as you might
for an actual script, but to show your understanding of every
step of the example program's execution. You will not be penalized
for too many comments, or for comments that are too long.
